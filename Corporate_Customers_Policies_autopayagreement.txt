Customer Agreements and Policies

Automatic Payments â€“ Terms and Conditions

By enrolling in this recurring payment program, you authorize Comcast: (a) to initiate recurring automated clearing house (ACH) debit entries or debit card payments from the checking or savings account you specify, or (b) to initiate recurring charges from your specified credit card. The amount debited from your checking or savings account or charged to your credit card every month will be the then balance on your account. Your balance is the amount on your Comcast statement. Once your enrollment is processed, all payments will be automatically withdrawn from your specified checking or savings account or charged to the designated credit or debit card on the Comcast statement due date, unless you terminate your authorization in the manner described herein.

You agree to be bound by any rules your financial institution requires for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers and/or that your debit or credit card issuer requires for pre-authorized debit or credit card transactions. You are responsible for all fees charged by your financial institution associated with the pre-authorized payment option.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION AT ANY TIME ONLINE BY LOGGING INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AT CUSTOMER.XFINITY.COM AND TERMINATING AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS OR BY CALLING YOUR LOCAL COMCAST OFFICE AT 1-800-266-2278 AND TERMINATING YOUR AUTHORIZATION WITH A COMCAST CUSTOMER ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE.

You must update all changes to your checking/savings account or credit/debit card information by logging into your account at customer.xfinity.com. If you do not update your checking/savings account or credit/debit card information and Comcast is unable to charge your credit card or withdraw funds from your debit card, checking account, or savings account for the amount due on your Comcast account, you may be subject to applicable late fees, returned item charges and any fees or charges assessed by your financial institution.

Comcast will make your monthly statement available to you online. You can access your monthly statement by logging into your account at customer.xfinity.com and clicking View Billing on the Overview tab or switching to the Billing tab. You agree to review each bill you receive and give Comcast notice of any errors or disputed charges at least 72 hours prior to your statement due date.

COMCAST SHALL BEAR NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES OF ANY KIND THAT YOU MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF A PAYMENT MADE ON ITEMS INCORRECTLY BILLED OR FOR ANY DELAY IN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH YOUR ACCOUNT IS DEBITED OR YOUR CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED.

Comcast reserves the right to change these terms or terminate this Program at any time. Notice may be given on or with your statement or by other methods.

These terms do not in any way terminate, amend or modify other terms, agreements or policies that apply to your Comcast account or any Comcast services you receive or other agreements you may have with Comcast.
